## Abstract

This thesis explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is currently influencing managerial practices and examines potential future impacts. AI adoption in business is on the rise, with many companies acknowledging its potential as a key driver in the future of industry. However, there exists a significant gap between this theoretical enthusiasm and the practical reality of widespread AI implementation. This research identifies management practices as a crucial factor affecting the success of technological transition to AI within organizations.

Through an in-depth literature review, theoretical models like Total Quality Management (TQM), and survey-based data collection from various industry managers, this study analyzes the relationship between AI integration and management. A robust statistical analysis was conducted using IBM's software, providing valuable insights into data trends and correlations that support the thesis findings. Key findings emphasize the need for a balanced relationship of trust between managers and AI, particularly in enhancing productivity while maintaining ethical standards.

## Research Objectives

1. Assess the current impact of AI on managerial and leadership practices.
2. Understand managerial perceptions of AI and its integration.
3. Identify factors contributing to the successful or unsuccessful adoption of AI in management.
4. Explore the ethical, social, and technical limitations of AI in management.

## Structure

The thesis is structured into several key sections:
- **Literature Review**: Covers core concepts of management, AI in professional settings, ethical concerns, and the intersection between AI and managerial roles.
- **Methodology**: Describes the research methods, including survey design, statistical analysis using IBM software, and interpretation of findings.
- **Results and Discussion**: Presents survey findings, analysis of AI's influence on management, and discussion of identified challenges and opportunities.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizes findings and provides recommendations for future research and practical strategies for businesses.

## Key Findings

The study concludes that a healthy technological transition to AI requires both technical readiness and strong managerial trust. A thorough understanding of AI’s capabilities and limitations, combined with ethical and transparent practices, will be essential for the sustainable integration of AI in management roles.
